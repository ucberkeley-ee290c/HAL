# FPGA Prototyping

## Bitstreams Catalog

### bearlyarty

#### `bearlyarty_1_rocket_1_saturn.bit`

- no FPU on rocket (using TinyRocket config)

- 32Mhz peripheral clock (affects mtime and UART)

- could not probe into Saturn core, all JTAG command returns `0x01`

#### `bearlyarty_2_rocket.bit`

- cannot examine target

#### `bearlyarty_1_rocket_fpu.bit`

- add FPU on rocket

### osciarty

#### `osciarty_32MHz.bit`

- 32Mhz peripheral clock (affects mtime and UART)

- TL not working

#### `osciarty_148kHz.bit`

- 148kHz system & Serial-TL clock

- throttle down to be compatible with MCU bringup setup

## Wiring

Arty JD port

|     |     |       |       |       | square pad |
| --- | --- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| 3V3 | GND | NC    | TCK   | nTRST | TDO        |
| 3V3 | GND | NC    | nRST  | TMS   | TDI        |

Note: `nTRST` is JTAG reset, `nRST` is system reset. For a minimal set up, the two reset lines do not need to be connected.

## Software Setup

1. Download `osciarty.bit`

2. Open vivado, open hardware manager

![](docs/vivado_hardware_manager.png)

3. Click "Open target" -> "Auto Connect"

5. 

##### Windows

Open PowerShell in the folder, enter

```bash
cd ./jtag/
openocd.exe -f .\osciarty.cfg
```

And in another PowerShell terminal, enter

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb.exe
```

It should prompt the following message

```bash

Then, enter `target remote localhost:3333`

```bash
