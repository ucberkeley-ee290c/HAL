# HAL

_Note: this repo is still in alpha stage development, and is subject to major changes._

This is the hardware abstraction library support of Chipyard-generated RISC-V SoCs. 

## Tutorials

To setup the software environment, refer to [Software Development Environment Installation Tutorial](https://github.com/ucberkeley-ee290c/HAL/blob/main/firmware/README.md)

To setup FPGA for prototyping, refer to [FPGA Tutorial](https://github.com/ucberkeley-ee290c/HAL/blob/main/fpga/README.md)

## Directory Structure

`/firmware` stores the HAL code for all supported chips.

`/fpga` stores the bitstream and information for emulating designs on fpga.

`/jtag` stores the files and information for JTAG debugging sessions.
